**New Century COBOL**

Nobody loves COBOL, yet it has never truly been replaced. For decades, COBOL has quietly powered the world’s most critical business systems—banking, insurance, government, aviation. Every transaction, every identity verification may carry its trace. *New Century COBOL* is a tribute to this underestimated language and an exploration into the future: bringing legacy code into conversation with the modern world.
